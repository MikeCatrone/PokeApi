# PokeApi
<p>This is a small project I started to help me practice with API calls, and rendering some data to the browser with vanilla Javascript. Growing up I was a huge Pokemon fan, so I decided to try and build a small browser app to render some Pokemon sprite graphics</p>
<p>It's a little quirky but once it gets going it works 😄</p>
